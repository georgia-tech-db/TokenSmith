    question: "Show me what happens during a lossy decomposition"
    expected_answer: "A lossy decomposition occurs when a relation R is decomposed into smaller relations R1 and R2 such that joining them back together produces spurious tuples not present in the original relation, resulting in loss of information about which attribute combinations actually existed. This happens when the intersection of R1 and R2 does not form a superkey for either relation, violating the lossless-join condition; the natural join of the decomposed relations generates extra tuples from invalid combinations, making it impossible to reconstruct the original data accurately, which is why database design insists that all decompositions must be lossless."

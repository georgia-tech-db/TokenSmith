            <pre>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to learn patterns from data, enabling them to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for each task. It focuses on developing systems that improve at tasks through experience, such as classifying data, predicting outcomes, or recognizing patterns. Unlike traditional programming, which follows strict rules, machine learning algorithms adapt and refine their performance based on the data they process.</pre>

            <pre>Retrieval augmented generation combines information retrieval with text generation, allowing models to access external knowledge to produce more accurate responses.</pre>
            
            <h4>Retrieved Answer:</h4>
            <pre>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique in natural language processing (NLP) that combines information retrieval with text generation. It involves two main steps: 1. **Information Retrieval**: The system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus based on a query. This is similar to how traditional information retrieval systems work, where the system finds documents similar to a given input. 2. **Text Generation**: The retrieved information is then used to generate a response. This step involves using the retrieved information to create a coherent and contextually relevant answer, often using a language model. RAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the model needs to generate answers based on external information, such as answering questions about a specific topic or providing explanations based on a large dataset. It enhances the model's ability to provide accurate and contextually appropriate responses by incorporating external information into the generation process. For example, if a user asks a question about a recent event, the system might retrieve articles or news reports related to that event and then use those documents to generate a detailed and accurate answer. This approach is different from traditional text generation models that rely solely on their training data. RAG allows the model to access external information, making the generated responses more informative and accurate.</pre>

            <h4>Retrieved Answer:</h4>
            <pre>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn patterns from data. It's like training a brain to recognize patterns by feeding it lots of examples. For instance, a deep learning model can learn to identify cats in photos by analyzing thousands of cat images, gradually improving its ability to recognize cats with more accuracy. Unlike traditional machine learning, deep learning automatically learns features from raw data, making it powerful for tasks like image recognition, speech processing, and natural language understanding.</pre>

            <pre>Document indexing processes text by breaking it into chunks, creating embeddings, and storing them in a searchable vector database.</pre>
            
            <h4>Retrieved Answer:</h4>
            <pre>Document indexing involves creating a structured reference to help quickly locate documents based on their content. Here's how it works: 1. **Inverted Index**: - Each keyword is mapped to a list of documents containing it. For example, the word "motorcycle" might point to documents about motorcycles. - This allows efficient retrieval of documents containing specific keywords. 2. **Sparse Indexing**: - Only a subset of keywords (or a sparse index) is stored, reducing space. This is similar to a book's index, which lists key terms but not every occurrence. 3. **Logical Queries**: - Users can search using logical operators (AND, OR, NOT). For instance, "motorcycle AND maintenance" finds documents with both terms. 4. **Compression**: - Document sets for keywords are stored compactly to save space. This might involve approximate retrieval, where some relevant documents might be missed (false drops). 5. **Relevance Ranking**: - Advanced indexes track keyword proximity to rank results by relevance, improving search accuracy. This system enables fast, efficient retrieval of information from large document collections.</pre>
